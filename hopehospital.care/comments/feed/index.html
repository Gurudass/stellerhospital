					<description><![CDATA[I was relieved to see that PURELL was finally available and in quantity that is required for my practice.
Purell is a reputable brand, used in healthcare and in zero supply for non health care for months during the pandemic. Ours was in fact dwindling.
Great product, great company to deal with, quick service and will buy again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great product for getting that freshness in your breath. It is a bit strong in taste, however, is effective in killing my bad morning breath and the taste is great. I was surprised that the bottle was smaller than what I would normally get in the store, however it is a good value for the amount you get. Would highly recommend if you want something very strong and I sometimes use it to treat my gingivitis.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Listerine bottles arrived late and was never attempted to be delivered by the guaranteed date. Also, these bottles are not the large Liter bottles that are the same price, but rather half the size and is unsuitable for an office setting. The only positive is that the expiry date seems to be 2020, which is plenty of time to use the product.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lighter, more compact, and more easily maneuverable than a regular wheelchair. Folds well and goes in back of SUV so much easier than the full size version. Also, compared to the full size drive, the arm rests come forward further, allowing better leverage when the patient tries to stand up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a new transition for my 91 year old father...it became too difficult for him to walk with a walker when we go on trips and so I ordered this chair. He fits in it and it was ready to use right out of the box. I wouldn\&#039;t even count hooking on the foot rests as assembly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We purchased this product to test the temps of our wood stove. Always cared for, never dropped, never allowed to be near heat, it started to act strange this past spring at the end of the heating season. I figured it was a weak battery and took the battery out for the season, storing it in its original box.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[At the suggestion of a few people in a cooking thread at the-boneyard.com, I purchased this infrared thermometer. I had asked a question about the best pan to sauté mushrooms and onions, and was told the temperature which the butter/oil is added is far more important.]]></description>
