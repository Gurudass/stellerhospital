It occurs when the body is unable to produce enough insulin or effectively use the insulin it produces, resulting in an inability to regulate blood sugar levels.<\/p>\n<p>Types of Diabetes<\/p>\n<p><strong>Type 1 diabetes<\/strong> &#8211; Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder in which the body&#8217;s immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells (beta cells) in the pancreas, leading to a complete lack of insulin. This type of diabetes typically develops in children and young adults, and requires lifelong insulin therapy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Type 2 Diabetes<\/strong> &#8211; Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder in which the body becomes resistant to the effects of insulin and\/or the pancreas doesn&#8217;t produce enough insulin to meet the body&#8217;s needs. It is the most common form of diabetes and often develops in adulthood as a result of a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors such as obesity, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gestational Diabetes<\/strong> &#8211; Pregnancy-related elevated blood sugar (glucose) is called gestational diabetes. Pregnancy hormones make insulin less efficient, raising blood sugar. Gestational diabetes increases the risk of type 2 diabetes in women and their children later. Dietary adjustments and insulin therapy may help manage blood sugar during pregnancy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the signs and symptoms of Diabetes?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased thirst and hunger<\/li>\n<li>Fatigue<\/li>\n<li>Blurred vision<\/li>\n<li>Slow healing cuts\/bruises<\/li>\n<li>Frequent urination<\/li>\n<li>Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet<\/li>\n<li>Unplanned weight loss<\/li>\n<li>Dry mouth<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>What causes Diabetes in our life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Diabetes is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It can occur when the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin (Type1 Diabetes), or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces(Type 2 Diabetes).<\/p>\n<p>Factors that may contribute to the development of diabetes include a family history of the disease, obesity, lack of physical activity, unhealthy diet, chronic stress, aging, viral infections, certain medications, smoking, and high blood pressure and cholesterol levels.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Who is susceptible to diabetes?

It is used to diagnose diabetes, as higher than normal levels of glucose in the blood can indicate the presence of the disease. The test results can also be used to monitor blood sugar levels in people who have already been diagnosed with diabetes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A1C test<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The A1C test, also known as the hemoglobin A1C or HbA1C test, measures the average blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months. It works by measuring the amount of glucose that has attached to hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. The higher the blood sugar levels, the more glucose will attach to the hemoglobin. A result of 6.5% or higher on the A1C test is generally considered to indicate diabetes. The A1C test is used to diagnose and manage diabetes, as it provides a more comprehensive view of a person&#8217;s overall blood sugar control over time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Oral glucose tolerance test<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is a medical test used to diagnose type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes. It measures how well the body is able to handle a large amount of glucose (sugar).<\/p>\n<p>During the test, a person is given a sweet drink containing 75-100 grams of glucose, and their blood sugar levels are measured at various intervals (usually every 30 to 60 minutes) over the next 2 hours.<\/p>\n<p>The test can help diagnose diabetes if the blood sugar levels remain elevated, indicating that the body is unable to properly use the glucose. The OGTT is also used to monitor glucose metabolism in pregnant women and individuals with suspected insulin resistance.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Treatment options for Diabetes<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lifestyle changes such as diet, exercise, and weight management<\/li>\n<li>Medications, including insulin and oral glucose-lowering drugs<\/li>\n<li>Continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pump therapy<\/li>\n<li>Bariatric surgery for severe obesity-related diabetes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>How is insulin administered? How many insulin administration methods are there?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Subcutaneous:<\/strong> This is the most common method and involves injecting insulin just under the skin (usually in the abdomen, upper arm, thigh or buttocks).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Intravenous (IV):<\/strong> This method involves administering insulin directly into a vein, usually through an IV line in a hospital setting.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Inhalation:<\/strong> This method involves using an insulin inhaler to inhale insulin into the lungs, where it is absorbed into the bloodstream. This method is not as commonly used as subcutaneous injections.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Insulin pen:<\/strong> This object resembles a pen with a cap. Prefilled insulin pens and insulin cartridges can be easily used and discarded.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Jet Injection:<\/strong> A tiny spray of insulin is delivered through your skin using high pressure in this needleless administration technique.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hope Hospitals is a medical facility that offers diabetes treatment and care.
