This can result in brain damage, disability, and even death.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Types<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Ischemic stroke<\/strong> is a type of stroke that occurs when a blood clot prevents blood from flowing to the brain.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hemorrhagic stroke<\/strong> is one that results from bleeding in the brain and is typically brought on by the rupture of a blood vessel.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What stroke symptoms should you watch out for?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg, especially on one side of the body<\/li>\n<li>Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech<\/li>\n<li>Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes<\/li>\n<li>Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination<\/li>\n<li>Sudden severe headache with no known cause<\/li>\n<li>Face drooping, arm weakness, and speech difficult<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Does it impact anyone? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Stroke can impact anyone, regardless of age, gender, or ethnicity. Hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol), Type 2 diabetes, as well as those who have a previous stroke, heart attack, or dysrhythmia rhythms such atrial fibrillation, are other medical disorders that raise the risk of stroke.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How might a stroke impact my body?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The same way a heart attack affects your heart, strokes affect your brain. As a result of the loss of blood flow caused by a stroke, a portion of your brain is deprived of oxygen. The damaged brain cells go oxygen-starved and quit functioning if they aren&#8217;t given enough oxygen.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Your brain cells will perish if you deprive them of oxygen for too long. Loss of function in a previously functional region of the brain can be irreversible if enough of its cells perish. Restoring blood flow, however, might stop that kind of harm from occurring or at least lessen how bad it is. Time is therefore very important when treating a stroke.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What examinations will be performed to identify this condition?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>CT (computerized tomography)<\/li>\n<li>Lab blood tests (looking for signs of infections or heart damage, checking clotting ability and blood sugar levels, testing how well kidneys and liver function, etc.).<\/li>\n<li>Electrocardiogram (also known as an EKG or ECG) to check sure a heart condition isn&#8217;t the cause of the issue.<\/li>\n<li>MRI scans (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)<\/li>\n<li>Electroencephalography (EEG) can rule out seizures or other related issues.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>What are the treatment options for Stroke?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Thrombolytic therapy <\/strong>is the process of breaking up or dissolving blood clots with medicines.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Anticoagulants and antiplatelet therapy <\/strong>Anticoagulants limit the synthesis of fibrin and the growth of clots by slowing the clotting process. Antiplatelet medications limit clot formation and growth as well as the clumping of platelets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Endovascular therapy<\/strong> the stroke-causing clot is removed using a catheter inserted into the brain as part of the procedure.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rehabilitation therapy<\/strong> is a course of various therapies intended to aid in the recovery of skills lost due to a stroke. Rehabilitation can assist with movement, speech, strength, and daily living skills, depending on the areas of your brain that were impaired by the stroke.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Surgical intervention<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Carotid endarterectomy<\/strong> is a surgical operation in which a surgeon clears fatty deposits from one of the two carotid arteries, the brain&#8217;s major blood supply.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Intracranial stenting<\/strong> is a long-term device that unblocks obstructed arteries to enhance blood flow to the brain.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>How can I lessen or completely avoid my risk of having a stroke?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You can lower your risk of stroke by adopting the following lifestyle changes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintaining a healthy diet (low in salt, saturated fat, and added sugars)<\/li>\n<li>Exercising regularly<\/li>\n<li>Quitting smoking<\/li>\n<li>Limiting alcohol consumption<\/li>\n<li>Managing underlying health conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation.<\/li>\n<li>Taking prescribed medications as directed by a doctor<\/li>\n<li>Controlling stress and getting enough sleep.<\/li>\n<li>It is also important to have regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor your health and identify and treat potential risk factors\u00a0for\u00a0stroke.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, stroke is a serious medical condition that requires prompt treatment.
