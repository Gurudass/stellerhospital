This hormonal excess leads to a hyperthyroidism.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does my thyroid work?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The thyroid gland produces hormones that regulate many important bodily functions, such as metabolism, heart rate, and body temperature. Thyroid hormones play a critical role in controlling the body&#8217;s use of energy, and when the thyroid produces too much or too little of these hormones, it can affect overall health. In hyperthyroidism, the thyroid produces an excessive amount of these hormones, leading to an overactive metabolism and causing symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, weight loss, and nervousness.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, in hypothyroidism, the thyroid produces too little hormone, resulting in a sluggish metabolism and causing symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and depression. It&#8217;s important to maintain normal thyroid function for overall health and well-being.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for hyperthyroidism<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Grave\u2019s disease<\/strong> is an immune system condition that causes excessive thyroid hormone production (hyperthyroidism)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Multi nodular goiter<\/strong> is an enlargement of the thyroid gland caused by multiple thyroid nodules.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Thyroiditis <\/strong>&#8211; Inflammation of the thyroid gland<\/li>\n<li>Excessive iodine intake<\/li>\n<li>Tumors on the thyroid gland<\/li>\n<li>Taking too much thyroid hormone medication<\/li>\n<li>Hormonal imbalance<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>What are the symptoms of Hyperthyroidism?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weight loss<\/li>\n<li>Menstrual changes<\/li>\n<li>Increased appetite<\/li>\n<li>Rapid heart beat<\/li>\n<li>Diarrhea and more frequent bowel movements<\/li>\n<li>Feeling nervous<\/li>\n<li>Vision changes<\/li>\n<li>Excessive sweating<\/li>\n<li>Swelling and enlargement of the neck from an enlarged thyroid gland<\/li>\n<li>Sleep issues<\/li>\n<li>Muscle weakness<\/li>\n<li>Bulging of the eyes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>What are the complications associated with Hyperthyroidism?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hyperthyroidism can lead to various complications, including:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Heart problems such as atrial fibrillation, heart palpitations, heart failure<\/li>\n<li>Osteoporosis (bone loss)<\/li>\n<li>Eye problems, including bulging eyes<\/li>\n<li>Skin thinning and easy bruising<\/li>\n<li>Mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression<\/li>\n<li>Preterm labor and low birth weight in pregnant women<\/li>\n<li>Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) after treatment<\/li>\n<li>Life-threatening conditions such as\u00a0thyroid\u00a0storm<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Diagnostic tests for Hyperthyroidism<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Diagnostic tests for hyperthyroidism are used to identify the presence and cause of excessive thyroid hormone production. Some common diagnostic tests include:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>TSH test:<\/strong> measures the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) produced by the pituitary gland, which should be low in hyperthyroidism.<\/li>\n<li><strong>T4 test:<\/strong> measures the amount of the hormone thyroxine (T4) in the blood, which is usually high in hyperthyroidism.<\/li>\n<li><strong>T3 test:<\/strong> measures the amount of the hormone triiodothyronine (T3) in the blood, which may also be elevated in hyperthyroidism.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Thyroid scan:<\/strong> uses radioactive material to produce images of the thyroid gland and detect any abnormal growths or function.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Thyroid biopsy:<\/strong> involves removing a small sample of thyroid tissue for examination under a microscope to determine the cause of hyperthyroidism.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Antibody tests:<\/strong> measure levels of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSIs), which may be elevated in autoimmune conditions like Graves&#8217; disease.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>These tests, along with a thorough evaluation of symptoms and medical history, can help healthcare providers diagnose hyperthyroidism and determine the most appropriate treatment plan.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Treatment options for Hyperthyroidism<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Surgical<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Thyroidectomy:<\/strong> Removal of all or part of the thyroid gland. This is typically performed when the hyperthyroidism is caused by a nodule or goiter and medication is not effective.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Radioactive Iodine (RAI) Ablation:<\/strong> Destroys the overactive thyroid cells using radioactive iodine<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Non- Surgical<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Medications (e.g., antithyroid drugs):<\/strong> Block the production of thyroid hormone.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Beta blockers:<\/strong> Control symptoms such as rapid heartbeat and sweating<\/li>\n<li><strong>Radioiodine Therapy:<\/strong> Reduces the amount of hormone the thyroid gland produces.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Subtotal Thyroidectomy:<\/strong> Removal of most of the thyroid gland preserving some normal thyroid tissue. This option is usually used when a patient has very high levels of thyroid hormone and the risks associated with removing the entire gland are too great.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At Hope Hospital, the treatment of hyperthyroidism typically involves a multi-disciplinary approach, including endocrinologists, surgeons, and radiologists, to provide comprehensive and individualized care for patients. The most appropriate treatment option will depend on the underlying cause of hyperthyroidism, the severity of symptoms, and the overall health of the patient. We use medications such as antithyroid drugs or beta blockers to manage symptoms and control hormone production. In cases where medical management is not sufficient, the hospital may also offer radioactive iodine therapy or surgical options such as a thyroidectomy to remove part or all of the thyroid gland. The goal of treatment at Hope Hospital is to effectively manage symptoms and restore the patient&#8217;s health and well-being.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hyperthyroidism is a medical condition where the thyroid gland, a small butterfly-shaped organ located in the neck, produces an excessive amount of thyroid hormones, called thyroxine and triiodothyronine.
